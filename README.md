## Implementation

My game has a fully controllable player with a sprite made by me. I also made custom sprites for the enemies. I made a sprite for the charging enemy also but it was not working. I was not able to get the score to keep counting. The camera also follows the player. There are also multiple levels with additional spritework done by me. I would say that I created elaborate and unique levels using the assets provided to me. I also paid attention to the game experience. The game starts with a more horizontal level then a vertical level and then a mix of both on the third level. The third level also contains a very small story about finding an oasis in the desert.
